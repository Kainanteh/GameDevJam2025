Gnomolipsis is a real-time tactical strategy game where you must expand your domain, collect resources, and conquer enemy bases. Built on a system of interactive paths and intelligent decisions, each game challenges your planning and adaptation.

Lead your troops from your Mushroom Barracks, explore the map, conquer neutral forts, and confront other rebel gnomes.

Do you have what it takes to master all three scenarios and claim ultimate victory?


How to Play:
Click on your blue headquarters and drag the cursor to another cell to create paths.

If the path ends at a resource, a collector will be sent to bring back food, increasing your production rate.

If it ends at an enemy HQ, a soldier will be dispatched to automatically attack it.

If it ends at an empty cell, an explorer will be sent, who can later be redirected.

Explorers reveal the terrain and, once they arrive, can be sent again toward resources or enemies.

Conquer neutral forts by sending more soldiers than your opponent. If both players send troops, the fort enters a dispute until one side gains control.

Destroy enemy headquarters to progress. If your own is destroyed, you lose.
